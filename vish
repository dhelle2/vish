# vishd - vish with documentation
# Create an executable shell file with one command
# instead of three. Files which are not marked as
# executables must instead be sourced or changed
# to executable permission manually as specified below.
# This script also automatically reminds you to start
# writing the script by starting an editor.
# TBD: allow a choice of editors in a .vishdrc file
# or on the command line.
# also TBD: Allow for a choice of file extensions (limits
# errors in filename creation - options may include .sh,
# .bash, etc.)
